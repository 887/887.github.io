I didn&rsquo;t really notice it at home because i&rsquo;m using the &lsquo;warm&rsquo;-yellow lamps
and i only felt the pain from it for few days, a week before and took some Ibuprofen which made it go away.</p><p>It first was suspected to be hepatitis, but i was negative on all types and it turned out to be Gallstones.</p><p>I spent a week in two different hospitals, because they didn&rsquo;t have the tool to break up the stone in the first one, and i was on heavy Antibiotics because my liver wasn&rsquo;t working.
I got all my vaccine shots refreshed in September so i didn&rsquo;t catch anything. üê±</p><p>I got my gallbladder removed and now i&rsquo;m just waiting on getting a final endoscopy to get the last stent out, than i&rsquo;m back to full health.</p><p>The gallbladder was inflamed and there was still a fragment in the gallcanal which they didn&rsquo;t read in the paperwork. Operation was supposed to be an hour but took longer. üòº</p><p>By my count i could have died almost 3 times, maybe more.</p><p>The doctors and nurses all showed of how things work and taught their students or junior doctors how to do their job and i received comments on how good my health is otherwise. It&rsquo;s comforting because they all didn&rsquo;t seem to concerned about me and used me as an example for how a patient should look like. I can&rsquo;t buy health for that but since i work on software i like it when things are easily identifiable.
It&rsquo;s not exactly the same, but i felt the healthcare system was working for me and if i didn&rsquo;t take care of my health i would have had way more complications and died.
One doctor that asked about my history told me to stay-the-course.
That&rsquo;s what i had in mind and now it&rsquo;s doctors orders. üòπ</p><p>I lost a lot of weight years ago and worked out a lot since then.<br>Looks like having been overweight caught up with me eventually though.</p><p>My personal doctor called my journey through this an Odyssey and way harder than it should have been because there were lots of complications and i was at the doctors every few days. I didn&rsquo;t comment because this isn&rsquo;t how i think.
I did everything under my control the best i could. I worked this journey like i work on code. You just do one step after the other and do the best you can each step. Complaints about the process get you nowhere. I answered all the questions, was friendly and worked this out. I got apologies for mistakes made at steps by the doctors. I felt like everyone was doing their best and i didn&rsquo;t even know they did something wrong until they apologized, when they made mistakes. I can&rsquo;t expect them to work perfect, i can only try to be my best and i felt like i was.
It wasn&rsquo;t really an Odyssey where i wanted to give up at any point because I made my choice to live and so i work the situation.</p><p>The first few weeks with this i spent working on my project, when i still could, but the operation for the removal threw me out of my routine.
The pain and a big hematoma bulb from the operation, as well as what the doctors told me meant i couldn&rsquo;t do sports and lift heavy things until things are healed.
So i spent time healing and recovering. Just doing the little things around the house carefully was enough. üò∫</p><p>I spent this week coding a lot and did &rsquo;light&rsquo; workout. Building back my strength. I&rsquo;m slowly getting back to heavier workouts.</p><p>I have no complications from having no gallblader anymore and can still eat what i want.</p><p>I remember a time when i was younger. There this would have thrown me out and made me change my life. But now.. it wasn&rsquo;t life changing.
Like i got the introspective look on my life when i was in pain, but compared to what i got when i was younger my mind went more along these lines:
Well, i&rsquo;m paying for what we broke figuring myself out.
The course we are on isn&rsquo;t bad though, the world tells me i did good. All i can do i&rsquo;m doing, to survive this. This is paying a fee for not always being on this course, and that&rsquo;s ok.
Same as sometimes you have good karma you also get bad karma from things you did in the past.</p><p>I was roommates with other patients in the hospital that were there because of their choices in life too.
A few of them actively self-destroying, others trying to get more years out of life.</p><p>A lot of time for self reflection, but no big revelations. Huh.
It was a good experience in my book.</p><p>I got lots more planned in the coming months and i have project plans and spreadsheets on what i do want to do.</p><p>tl;dr;
I went through a lot. I took care of my health. Now i can continue on.
Life is good. No impact on my long-term-health. üëç</p></div></article></main></div><footer class=footer><span class=footer_item></span>&nbsp;<div class=footer_social-icons><a href=https://github.com/887 target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer me" title=Github><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M9 19c-5 1.5-5-2.5-7-3m14 6v-3.87a3.37 3.37.0 00-.94-2.61c3.14-.35 6.44-1.54 6.44-7A5.44 5.44.0 0020 4.77 5.07 5.07.0 0019.91 1S18.73.65 16 2.48a13.38 13.38.0 00-7 0C6.27.65 5.09 1 5.09 1A5.07 5.07.0 005 4.77 5.44 5.44.0 003.5 8.55c0 5.42 3.3 6.61 6.44 7A3.37 3.37.0 009 18.13V22"/></svg></a><a href=https://twitter.com/887_2300 target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer me" title=Twitter><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M23 3a10.9 10.9.0 01-3.14 1.53 4.48 4.48.0 00-7.86 3v1A10.66 10.66.0 013 4s-4 9 5 13a11.64 11.64.0 01-7 2c9 5 20 0 20-11.5a4.5 4.5.0 00-.08-.83A7.72 7.72.0 0023 3z"/></svg></a><a href=index.xml target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer me" title=Rss><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M4 11a9 9 0 019 9"/><path d="M4 4a16 16 0 0116 16"/><circle cx="5" cy="19" r="1"/></svg></a></div><small class=footer_copyright>¬© 2024 887.
