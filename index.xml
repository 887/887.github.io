I didn&amp;rsquo;t really notice it at home because i&amp;rsquo;m using the &amp;lsquo;warm&amp;rsquo;-yellow lamps and i only felt the pain from it for few days, a week before and took some Ibuprofen which made it go away.
It first was suspected to be hepatitis, but i was negative on all types and it turned out to be Gallstones.</description></item><item><title>The First Law</title><link>/books/the-first-law/</link><pubDate>Sun, 10 Dec 2023 14:50:51 +0100</pubDate><guid>/books/the-first-law/</guid><description>It&amp;rsquo;s violent and dark. Very graphical. But it&amp;rsquo;s a very well done. The character development and philosophy made me continue on reading it. In the second book a lot of things come together and it&amp;rsquo;s great. I would say this is getting better with an exponential curve, about 60% through the second book it will grip you hard if it hasn&amp;rsquo;t before.

somebody pressuring you you haven&amp;rsquo;t spent your time researching you haven&amp;rsquo;t done the math and calculated if you have the resources to commit to them -&amp;gt; Say let me get back to you, put it on your TODO lis.

Day by day i&amp;rsquo;m making progress.
The &amp;lsquo;Anyhow&amp;rsquo; crate is great.
Living and loving developing.
Blogging feels like procrastinating still, so i better get back to coding and physically working out.
This is nice, but actually doing &amp;lsquo;something&amp;rsquo; i can quantify,
like the compiler no longer yelling at me, there being a product or thing i can label &amp;lsquo;done&amp;rsquo; or my mind agreeing with that it&amp;rsquo;s progress makes me feel more productive.</description></item><item><title>The Three-Body Problem</title><link>/books/three-body-problem/</link><pubDate>Sat, 30 Sep 2023 16:01:16 +0200</pubDate><guid>/books/three-body-problem/</guid><description>The Dark Forest and wall facers/breakers are great concepts.
Time spent reading this get&amp;rsquo;s well rewarded. It really broadens your horizons.
I think the second book was the best and the last book felt like it could have been part of another series like the wandering earth by the same author.
But it was hard to finish this and it&amp;rsquo;s great SciFi and raises really good questions.

The series starts like a hard military novel, turns into very well done star trek and it&amp;rsquo;s own thing.
We gotta talk about the attempt at doing space opera in the middle of the series, but i&amp;rsquo;ll blame that on skippy.
I bit of the hard military fiction went into it&amp;rsquo;s own series starting with &amp;rsquo;trouble on paradise&amp;rsquo; while the strategies and scheming stayed with joe.
It has lots of little cultural references and quips but i enjoyed all the books.</description></item><item><title>Foundation</title><link>/books/foundation/</link><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jun 2023 23:01:16 +0200</pubDate><guid>/books/foundation/</guid><description>Asimov&amp;rsquo;s laws of robotics in i robot, bicentennial man and now foundation.
I watched all of this as movies growing up and now the TV show but only later in live i looked up who it all came from. Psycho-history indeed.
Egos, Games, People. Philosophy and ScFi.

A lot of Jeremy Robinsons other recent novels will join in the series as a crossover now for Infinite 3. (Already happened with Torment in Infinite 2.)
I would say read the first two and only read the rest if you are looking for fun but not hard self-reflecting question.
They are all good in their own way, but if you read anything by Jeremy, read Infintie 1 and 2.</description></item><item><title>Working on new idea</title><link>/posts/2023-05-02/</link><pubDate>Tue, 02 May 2023 20:44:07 +0200</pubDate><guid>/posts/2023-05-02/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve got a challenging idea brewing Instead of blogging about it i should keep working on it. Before starting a quick post.
Most of coding isn&amp;rsquo;t just coding, but doing research, writing tools, etc. I usually try not to develop a solution if there is a usable solution i can adapt. This isn&amp;rsquo;t the case on this. I&amp;rsquo;ll have to do the heavy lifting.
I used flutter yesterday, which is really nice.</description></item><item><title>About</title><link>/about/</link><pubDate>Sun, 30 Apr 2023 23:47:55 +0200</pubDate><guid>/about/</guid><description>Why 887? It&amp;rsquo;s a prime number and has 3 letters. That&amp;rsquo;s it. No deeper meaning behind it. I can type it on my keyboard hitting the keys really fast. That&amp;rsquo;s why.
Hi, i&amp;rsquo;m a software dev. Most of the software that i ended up writing over the decades has been for my employer or personal projects. So you can&amp;rsquo;t find my projects here on github. That&amp;rsquo;s &amp;lsquo;what happened&amp;rsquo;. I do use and support open source.</description></item><item><title>Red Rising</title><link>/books/red-rising/</link><pubDate>Sun, 30 Apr 2023 23:01:16 +0200</pubDate><guid>/books/red-rising/</guid><description>I read this and all following books in the series and highly recommend it.

So i&amp;rsquo;m starting a blog in 2023? Yes, mostly because it&amp;rsquo;s all markdown in the backend, and markdown is great to edit, for the most part ðŸ™ƒ. Since messaging people my thoughts is highly inefficient and wastes their time, more likely than not, i&amp;rsquo;m gonna write to my self on this nifty blog.</description></item></channel></rss>
