It&amp;rsquo;s a prime number and has 3 letters. That&amp;rsquo;s it. No deeper meaning behind it. I can type it on my keyboard hitting the keys really fast. That&amp;rsquo;s why.
Hi, i&amp;rsquo;m a software dev. Most of the software that i ended up writing over the decades has been for my employer or personal projects. So you can&amp;rsquo;t find my projects here on github. That&amp;rsquo;s &amp;lsquo;what happened&amp;rsquo;. I do use and support open source.</description></item><item><title>Red Rising</title><link>/books/red-rising/</link><pubDate>Sun, 30 Apr 2023 23:01:16 +0200</pubDate><guid>/books/red-rising/</guid><description>I read this and all following books in the series and highly recommend it.

So i&amp;rsquo;m starting a blog in 2023? Yes, mostly because it&amp;rsquo;s all markdown in the backend, and markdown is great to edit, for the most part ðŸ™ƒ. Since messaging people my thoughts is highly inefficient and wastes their time, more likely than not, i&amp;rsquo;m gonna write to my self on this nifty blog.</description></item></channel></rss>
